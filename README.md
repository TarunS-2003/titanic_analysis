# Titanic dataset analysis
&emsp; This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs exploratory data analysis on the given dataset and predicts if a person with certain attribute values would have survived the epic disaster.

## Technology used

### Python
- Python is the primary language used in performing analysis and building machine learning models to perform prediction. 
- matplotlib and seaborn, two of Python's visualization libraries were used in understanding the distribution of data across different attributes and visualizing the performance of a model. 
- scikit-learn, a Python based machine learning framework was utilized in constructing predictive models.

### Google Colaboratory

&emsp; Google Colaboratory, a cloud based Jupyter notebook service served as the development environment for this project.

### Microsoft Power BI

&emsp; Power BI is an interactive data visualization software that was used in creating a dashboard to represent interesting features from the dataset in the form of graphs and charts. 

## Model performance
&emsp; Three different models were constructed using the following traditional ML algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest <br/>
&emsp; The performance metrics of the above three algorithms on the dataset is depicted below: <br/><br/>
